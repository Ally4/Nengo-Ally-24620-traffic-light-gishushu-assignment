# Nengo-Ally-24620-traffic-light-gishushu-assignment

The assignment is about 2 roads that are meeting which creates a junction, as the 2 roads had 4 lanes, it means we are going to have 8 lanes, but also as we are going to have some lanes diverting into others it is going to me the 12, we are not going to consider the pedestrians because theirs is considered while the still the others are operating.

The following are the flow of the lane with their light status

Green E-W: Traffic moving East-West is allowed; North-South traffic must stop.
Yellow E-W: Caution for East-West traffic; prepare to stop.
Red E-W: No East-West traffic; North-South traffic can move.
Green N-S: Traffic moving North-South is allowed; East-West traffic must stop.
Yellow N-S: Caution for North-South traffic; prepare to stop.
Red N-S: No North-South traffic; East-West traffic can move.
Green NE-SW: Traffic moving from North-East to South-West is allowed; others must stop.
Yellow NE-SW: Caution for NE-SW traffic; prepare to stop.
Red NE-SW: No NE-SW traffic; all other movements can proceed.
Green NW-SE: Traffic moving from North-West to South-East is allowed; others must stop.
Yellow NW-SE: Caution for NW-SE traffic; prepare to stop.
Red NW-SE: No NW-SE traffic; all other movements can proceed.

Our main purpose is to make sure that we balance the traffic in the more effective and efficient way so that no one has to spend more time in the traffic.
